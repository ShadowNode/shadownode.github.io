## Disable Agricraft Particles 
A lot of players use Agricraft as way to enchance the speed at which their crops grow. Typically a single Agricarft spinkler can be used to multiply the speed, however, the effect does stack. This does pose a problem as all the particles from this causes a considerable amount of client-side render issues. This means that you will need to disable the for optimal FPS and to not lag out while around some bases. Thankfully, doing so is simple.

To disable the particles simply follow these steps while in game.

  1. Press Escape
  2. Click Mod Options
  3. Type `Agricraft` in the search box.
  4. Click `Config`
  5. Look for `AgriCraft Client Settings` and click it. You might need to scroll down.
  6. Click the `Disable particles button` if it says "false" it should turn green and display "true"
  7. Click done and enjoy the disabled particles.

## Disable Dynmaic Surroundings Fog

  1. Press Escape.
  2. Click Mod Options
  3. Type `Dynamic Surroundings`
  4. Click `Config`
