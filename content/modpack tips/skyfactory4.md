## Important Rules

Our Skyfactory 4 server has some additional rules on the server apart from the [general rules](/rules) you find on all our servers.

* Max of **2** Hopping Bonsai Pot per sappling type per island.
* Truffles drop as an item. Ensure you collect them properly.

As an improtant note, do not build a 1 chunk bases or farms. ShadowNode staff will take action as required. Staff response will depend on the situation.

## Commands

There's a good number of commands that you should be aware of for using this pack, espcially in group play and you can find them on our commands page under the [Island/Cave](/home/commands/#islandcave-area) section.

If you've never played on ShadowNode's Skyfactory 4 server, the way you get started is to run `/area create`. Make sure you read the rules in spawn first.
