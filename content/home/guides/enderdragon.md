## Summoning the Ender Dragon

To summon the Ender Dragon, you will need 43 blocks of obsidian in your inventory and 4 end crystals. Simply go to The End, and run the command `/portalplace` with the required materials in your inventory. Once the structure is built, place the 4 end crystals on each side of the structure and the ender dragon should spawn!
