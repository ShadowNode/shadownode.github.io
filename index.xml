If you encounter a bug, or any issue with the items, please report it in our Discord Support channel. Our plugin allows us to ban the items in a way that allows you to still progress through the pack. Craft, Place, Use, and Near are all the different ways items can be banned.</description></item><item><title>Basic Commands</title><link>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/commands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/commands/</guid><description>Basic Commands Argument Required &amp;lt;&amp;gt; Required [] Optional Discord In order to join discord, you need to run the command /discord in game, this will give you the invite link in your chat window.

There are two types of Chunk Loaders, Always On and Online Only. To view chunk borders, hit F3+g
The most basic command in the plugin is /betterchunkloader, or just /bcl for short. Executing this command will open an interface in the chat that the user may interact with.</description></item><item><title>Claiming</title><link>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/guides/claiming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/guides/claiming/</guid><description>Claiming All of our servers use the latest Grief Prevention plugin for claiming.
How to Claim To claim you can either use a Golden Shovel you make, or one provide to you when you first join the server (some servers do not start with the golden shovel or have had their claim tool changed). Every block claimed is accounted for. You can buy claim blocks from the tokenshop, or from the store.</description></item><item><title>Contributing</title><link>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/guides/contributing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/guides/contributing/</guid><description>To contribute to this wiki all you need to do is follow this handy little guide!

Crates contain items, the quality of which depends on the tier of the crate. To open a create you must hold the crate key in your hand and right click the corresponding crate. You can obtain crate keys by either purchasing them from our store, or buy buying them in our token shop. Some items on this list may not be on your server as some modpacks don't have all the mods as others.</description></item><item><title>Github Gist</title><link>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/guides/gist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/guides/gist/</guid><description>How to Use Github Gist While other copy and paste tools, like Pastebin or Hastebin, are more popular then Github Gist, Github Gist is one of the better copy and paste tools. It doesn't have a character count and it's just as easy to use as other tools. Using a copy and paste tool like Gist is recommended if you have issues with client crashes since it keeps the formatting of the log, and makes it easier to read the file without having to download it.</description></item><item><title>Market</title><link>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/guides/market/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/guides/market/</guid><description>The Market Our market plugin is a custom plugin created by our owner, ShadowKitten.

We strongly recommend this launcher.

On most machines, you can right click the folder, click export files and select your destination.</description></item><item><title>Offensive Skins</title><link>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/guides/skins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/guides/skins/</guid><description>Offensive Skins If you're reading this, there's a good chance that you've been hit with a ban that says &amp;ldquo;Your skin is offensive, please change it&amp;rdquo;. You forgot to change your Hitler skin when you were trolling, don't worry! Even though you've quickly changed it, you still lost valuable playing time.
Don't want that to happen to you? Just do one quick thing: Check your skin! If you haven't changed it in a while, it might be good to take a quick look in game by using F5 or a site like NameMC.</description></item><item><title>Ranks</title><link>https://shadownode.github.io/server-info/ranks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadownode.github.io/server-info/ranks/</guid><description>Available Ranks On the server we have multiple ranks that you can contribute to acquire.
