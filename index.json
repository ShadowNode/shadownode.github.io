Discord is not effected by these commands.\n Island/Cave Area Any server that is a skyblock style or uses a predefined starting area will use this plugin to create your area. Along with the commands mentioned above, there are a few more commands for your island/cave.\nServers that fit into this category are servers like: Stoneblock, SkyFactory, Glacial Awakening.\n/area create Creates an area and automatically sets the area spawn point. This command wipes your inventory.\n/area spawn [name] [-f] Teleports you to the specified users island. Leaving the name blank will teleport you to your area.

For example if you run /banneditems it will most likely return you a message that at the bottom say 1/9, this means it has 9 pages and you can rotate through those page using this command!\nNote: On servers like infinity and vanilla this command does not exist!\n/server \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; This command will put you on the server you specify. Note: You still need that version/modpack You can also run /name replacing name with the server name for the same effect!\n/portalplace Rebuilds the Ender Dragon summoning structure.

There are two types of Chunk Loaders, Always On and Online Only. To view chunk borders, hit F3+g\nThe most basic command in the plugin is /betterchunkloader, or just /bcl for short. Executing this command will open an interface in the chat that the user may interact with. The interface will contain a list of active chunk loaders you currently own, along with some user-friendly icons. An example of the interface is below. Always On vs Online Only Always On is a chunk loader which is online 24/7 and will keep the chunk loaded. However, the chunk loader will stop loading the chunk after 3 days of activity. Once the owner returns, it will resume loading the chunk.The Online Only chunk loader will only load the chunk when the owner of the loader is online.\nChecking Your Balance To check the number of chunks you may use/have used, you can click the Balance or run /bcl bal. The interface will state the number of both Always Online and Online Only chunks that are currently active (used) and are available. How to Create Chunk Loaders From the main interface, you should click the Create icon or run /bcl create to begin the process of creating a Chunk Loader. An interface will open and should look like the following image. The interface will state the name of the chunk loader Owner. It will also give you the coordinates of the chunk that you are currently standing in. Please note that these coordinates are different than regular XYZ coordinates. To create an Always Online chunk loader or Online Only chunk loader, click their respective icons. You should be prompted with the following interface. The Radius icons will determine the size of the chunk loader. You can only load as many chunks as your balance allows. Hovering over the icon will display how many chunks will be loaded with each radius upgrade. After you select your radius size, your chunk loader will be created. You will be shown a confirmation window which will display your name, loader id, and state. If you'd like to delete your loader and regain your chunk balance, click the Delete icon. How to View Active Chunk Loaders Once you have Chunk Loaders active, running /bcl will contain some information regarding regarding your active chunk loaders. You can hover over the Chunk icon to view the coordinates of the chunk loader. Clicking View will pull up the same prompt that was displayed after you created your loader originally. How to Read Chunk Coordinates To view the coordinates of the chunk you are currently in, press F3. You will see the typical statistics of your game, which should resemble the image below. The value in the red box is your chunk coordinates.  Claiming All of our servers use the latest Grief Prevention plugin for claiming.\nHow to Claim To claim you can either use a Golden Shovel you make, or one provide to you when you first join the server (some servers do not start with the golden shovel or have had their claim tool changed). Every block claimed is accounted for. You can buy claim blocks from the tokenshop, or from the store. Before claiming any land, please make sure to check which method of claiming you currently are using, 2D or 3D. Once your method of choice is confirmed, we can begin claiming. If you are in 2D mode, right click two opposite corners of the intended claim. For 3D mode, right click two opposite corners, one at the lowest point in the claim, and the other at the highest point in the claim. You can right click the air or ground with a stick to see who claims the block you are looking at.\n2D vs 3D 2D means that no what Y level you claim the blocks on, Grief Prevention will make your claim from bedrock to make build level. 3D will require you to claim your area in a cube and will only claim what is inside the cube.\nHow to Subdivide Claims Subdividing your claim means making smaller sections in the bigger claim to allow people to build/access certain parts of your base. To subdivide claims, hold your golden shovel and run the command subdivideclaims. This changes your golden shovel to create smaller claims. This is always in 2D mode, but it reaches to the highest level of your main claim. When you select two corners you see iron blocks instead of golden blocks. To get out of subdivideclaims mode, scroll your mouse wheel off the golden shovel and then back onto it. This can be used to make towns and/or sell plots to other players for in-game currency.\n Crates We use a plugin called HuskyCrates to manage our crates. Crates contain items, the quality of which depends on the tier of the crate. To open a create you must hold the crate key in your hand and right click the corresponding crate. You can obtain crate keys by either purchasing them from our store, or buy buying them in our token shop. Some items on this list may not be on your server as some modpacks don't have all the mods as others.\n    Mod Common Uncommon Rare Legendary Exotic     Vanilla Iron Blocks Gold Blocks Coal Blocks Potatoes Spider Eyes Nether Warts Ender Pearls Bones Melon Seedes Leather Armor Name Tag Saddle Redstone Blocks Emerald Blocks Iron Horse Armor Blaze Powder Golden Apple Creeper Head Skeleton Head Zombie Head Obsidian Bookshelves Ender Chestplate Cake Gold Horse Armor Eyes of Ender Ghast Tears Wither Skeleton Head Anvil Sponge Ghast Tears Diamond Pickaxe Diamond Shovel Diamond Axe Diamond Hoe Prismarine Shard Nether Quartz Doomhammer Axe Rotokiller Hoe Mjolnir Pickaxe The Infernian Shovel Enchantment Table Beacon Nether Star Diamond Horse Armor Diamond Horse Armor Enchanted Golden Apple Chorus Fruit Mirkwood Bow Godkiller Sword   Draconic Evolution Generator Draconium Nugget Mob Grinder Draconium Ingot Wyvern Axe Dislocator Dislocator Pedestal Infused Obsidian Wyvern Pickaxe Wyvern Sword Draconic Core Basic Energy Crystal Crystal Binder Wrench Wyvern Helmet Wyvern Chestplate Wyvern Leggings Wyvern Boots Wyvern Bow Wyvern Shovel Energy Core Basic Fusion Crafter Basic Wireless Crystal   Ender IO Silicon Basic Capacitor Reservoir Photovoltaic Cell Sag Mill Alloy Smelter Stirling Generator Powered Light Energy Conduits Item Conduits Energetic Alloy Experience Rod Basic Capacitor Bank Experience Obelisk Item Filter Enchanter Vacuum Chestplate XP Vacuum Soul Binder Slice \u0026lsquo;n\u0026rsquo; Splice Vibrant Alloy Enhanced Energy Conduit Farming Station Filled Soul Vial Dark Steel Helmet Dark Steel Chestplate Dark Steel Leggings Dark Steel Boots Travel Anchor Advanced Filter The Vat   Immersive Engineering Wooden Crate Balloon Kinetic Dynamo Conveyer Belt Industrial Hemp Seeds Water Wheel Wind Mill LV Wire Coil Engineers Skyhook LV Wire Connector LV Wire Relay Treated Planks MV Wire Coil MV Wire Connector MV Relay Improved Windmill Engineers Work Bench Coke Brick Blast Brick Concrete Floodlight Revolver with Ammo   Botania Lexica Botania Black Lotus Mana in a Bottle Magnet Ring Vanilla Seeds Tiny Potato Wand of the Forest Living Wood Living Rock Mana Spreader Mana Pool Black Lotus Petal Apothecary Mana Steel Manasteel Helmet Manasteel Chestplate Manasteel Leggings Manasteel Boots Endoflame Clayconia Agricarnaton Hopperhock Mana Diamond Mana Pearl Terrestrial Agglomeration Set Horn of the Wold Band of Aura Band of Mana Full Mana Tablet Invisibility Cloak Ring of Dexterous Motion Base Runes Endo Flame Agricarnation Sojourne Sash Tier 2 Runes Thermalilly Terrasteel Helmet Terrasteel Chestplate Terrasteel Leggings Third Eye Terrasteel Blaze Lamp Alchemy Catalyst Overgrowth Seed Kekimurus     MultiMC MultiMC is a Minecraft launcher.

Aiming to provide players with the best experience possible, ShadowNode is proud to host over 15 diverse servers!\nRules These rules apply for our Forums, Discord, servers and all other services. By using our services, you are agreeing to follow these rules. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse. Staff are provided with a general guideline of punishments for each rule, however choose a punishment is at their discretion.\nRespect Staff and Staff Decisions  Do not in any way mock, abuse, argue with, or be disrespectful in general to any member of our staff. If you feel you have been mistreated by a staff member or believe a punishment you received is unjust, do not mock them or make a scene. Contact another member of the staff team to discuss the issue privately.  No Harassment, Flaming or Trolling  This includes repeated requests for something over DMs, frequent unwanted TPA requests, bullying someone in server chat or DMs, and any other kind of unwanted contact or abuse. We understand that friends may joke around with each other, but if a staff member asks you to stop, you should listen. Any joking around that includes cussing, vulgar sexual comments or hate speech will be punished as such.  No Foul Language, Hate Speech, Sexual Comments,Political/Religious Discussions, Drug Use Discussions  We want to provide a safe, positive and clean environment for everyone, so we have this rule to achieve that goal. Private conversations via whispers of this nature are allowed, provided one person is not harassing the other. Discussing ANY topic which talks about abusing drugs, whether they're legal drugs or illegal drugs, is not allowed.  No Advertising, Spamming or Attention-Seeking  This includes advertising other servers or Discords, spamming random stuff in chat, or just general spamming to get attention for something, such as trying to sell something. Bear in mind, that asking for the same thing every few minutes DOES count as spamming.  No Excessive Mobs/Items Inside Mob Spawners  Spawners MUST auto-kill mobs as soon as they spawn. You are NOT allowed to have a spawner which requires a player to kill the mobs inside. Spawners must NOT clog with mobs or items. It is your responsibility to ensure that this doesn't happen.  No Cheating, Hacking, Glitching, Duping  This includes using third-party programs, plugins and/or bugs to gain an unfair advantage in gameplay over other players. X-Ray bugs/resource packs are not allowed. Optifine, BetterFPS and similar framerate-boosting mods ARE allowed, but may cause technical issues with your Minecraft client.  No Begging From Staff Members Our staff members have access to Creative mode to deal with technical issues and discover bugs, not to give you free stuff. See the Refunds policy if you've lost something due to a glitch/bug\nNo Alt Accounts, Using Another User's Account  Alt accounts, by definition, are other accounts that a player has access to. Alt accounts are often used to circumvent punishments that the staff have placed upon a different account. If you allow someone to use your account, and the account is banned, we will not lift the ban. You are responsible for your own account and anyone you let onto the account.  Don't Minimod - Let Staff Do Their Jobs  Mini-modding is telling people what the rules are and what they should do without first consulting staff to see if it is okay to tell those people. You may only teach other users about the rules if a staff member has explicitly given you permission to do so. If a user is asking about rules and no staff member is around to assist them, you may link them to this page.  Do Not Evade Our AFK Timer, Modifications or Limitations   Evading the AFK Timer includes, but is not limited to:\n Any item, machine, third-party program, or building which would cause the AFK detection system to not kick you while you are away from your computer.    Evading Modifications/Limitations includes, but is not limited to:\n Breaking blocks in areas you are not supposed to be able to modify, bypassing the profanity filter, and the use of banned items.    If you are a designated tester for the server, then this is allowed only while staff are present and watching\n  No Refunds of Items Lost, Unless the Loss of Items was Caused by a Proven Glitch with Our Services  We do not refund items lost to graves failing to spawn, clicking the Baubles menu with an item by accident, accidentally throwing an item in a Trash Can, or any similar issue. These are mod bugs and user error, neither of which we are responsible for. We do not refund items lost in unclaimed bases being raided or griefed. You are responsible for securing your own base. WE will use Prism to roll back/undo the damage, but that is all we will do. We do not refund easy-to-replace items such as sand, wood, dirt, Oak Fence, etc. Staff will decide on a case-by-case basis if an item should be refunded.  Do Not Auto-mine in the Overworld  We have mining worlds for a reason, so the terrain of the overworld doesn't get scarred by constant mining with Quarries or other mass-mining devices. If a quarry or quarry-like device is found in the overworld, it will be broken by a staff member. You may use a Quarry and/or similar devices for clearing space during base-building. 2x2 chunks maximum, with a 20 Y-level maximum.  Use English Only in the Main Chat  This is purely to help the staff troubleshoot thing sand keep the chat clear of confusing messages. Talking in other langues via private messages is allowed.  No Griefing  Griefing means to negatively change a building or area which you do not own or have permission to use. This includes, but is not limited to the following:  Breaking blocks from other's builds, stealing items or resources from others. This also applies to buildings and areas where the area is player owner, but it is not evident who exactly owned it.    No raiding or Stealing, Even if the Base is Unclaimed  Includes all resource types.  Mana, power and livestock are also considered resources.    Do Not Use Discord to Evade Mute Punishments  If a staff member mutes you, it's for a reason. Don't use our Discord services to bypass our punishment. Using the ban appeals forum to discuss your mute is allowed.  Do Not Impersonate a Staff Member  Impersonation means pretending to be someone else. This includes changing your nickname to a staff member's username/nickname or adding Staff/Admin/Etc to nay part of your nickname or rank.   Store Policies These policies apply for all purchases to ShadowNode and services or goods provided by ShadowNode. Punishments may include forfeiting of product or perks without refund permanently or for a given time.\nAll Transactions are Final  This means that you will not get any refunds for purchases, regardless of the circumstances, as you should've read what you wil be getting in depth in the first place.  No Abuse of a Product or its Perks  If you abuse any store items/ranks/privileges you will be subject to punishment without refund.  No Chargebacks  Chargebacks are when a customer reverses a transaction which has already been processed, usually done when goods are defective and therefore return the goods with a refund. As we do not do refunds here due to the digital nature of the services we provide, any chargebacks aimed at our services will be treated as an effort to defraud us.  No Purchases from Unconfirmed or Unauthorized Accounts  Purchases from unconfirmed accounts are not allowed. If a purchase was made from an account you are not authorized to use, the owner may contact us by email at payments@shadownode.ca to discuss refund. Once an account holder has contacted us and has been verified as the legitimate owner, we will terminate the account associated with the payment and they will be unable to access our services permanently.

Most often you will see mods active in the support tickets section of our Discord making sure everything is running smoothly.\nAdministrator As an Admin, you get the fancy red name! Admins are responsible for managing the background functions of the servers, such as setting up new packs and managing the current ones. Furthermore, admins assist in the training of mods and helpers to ensure that our staff team is running at tip-top shape!\nSenior Administrator These select members of our staff team get the dark red name colour. They are responsible in managing the staff team, discord server, and network. Hand picked by ShadowKitten, these members are some of the most trusted members in the entire network.\nDeveloper Developers are the meat and potatoes of the networks. Creating, updating, and optimizing plugins, mods, and their respective packs, developers ensure that the servers are running as fast and smoothly as possible.\nBuilders Builders help create the vision that the staff team wants ShadowNode to be! Designing our spawns, hubs, and sometimes events, the builders put our ideas to life and allow us to have a beautiful network.\n"},{"uri":"https://shadownode.github.io/tags/staff/","title":"staff","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://shadownode.github.io/tags/stoneblock2/","title":"stoneblock2","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://shadownode.github.io/tags/store/","title":"store","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://shadownode.github.io/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://shadownode.github.io/tags/teleport/","title":"teleport","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://shadownode.github.io/tags/tp/","title":"tp","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://shadownode.github.io/tags/ultimate/","title":"ultimate","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://shadownode.github.io/tags/vanilla/","title":"vanilla","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/","title":"Wiki","tags":[],"description":"","content":"In this category you will find all commands, guides, rules and answers to questions you may have about our server!\nIf you feel like something is missing from this wiki, just follow the steps laid out in our Contributing Page\n"}]
