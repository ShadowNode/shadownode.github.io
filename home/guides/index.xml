That being said, typically you would need to give them full access to inventories such as your chests, crates, ME systems, etc. You can solve this by issuing some commands that will set &amp;ldquo;flags&amp;rdquo;, these are extra settings that override the default behavior.</description></item><item><title>Chunkloaders</title><link>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/chunkloaders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/chunkloaders/</guid><description>Chunk Loaders Modded Chunk Loaders have been disabled on ShadowNode servers globally, therefore we have added a plugin known as Better Chunk Loaders to achieve their purpose. There are two types of Chunk Loaders, Always On and Online Only. To view chunk borders, hit F3+g
Always On vs Online Only Always On is a chunk loader which is online 24/7 and will keep the chunk loaded.

How to Claim To claim you can either use a Golden Shovel you make, or one provide to you when you first join the server (some servers do not start with the golden shovel or have had their claim tool changed). Every block claimed is accounted for. You can buy claim blocks from the tokenshop, or from the store.</description></item><item><title>Contributing</title><link>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/contributing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/contributing/</guid><description>To contribute to this wiki all you need to do is follow this handy little guide!

MultiMC While other copy and paste tools, like Pastebin or Hastebin, are more popular then Github Gist, Github Gist is one of the better copy and paste tools. It doesn't have a character count and it's just as easy to use as other tools.</description></item><item><title>Crates</title><link>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/crates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/crates/</guid><description>Crates We use a plugin called HuskyCrates to manage our crates. Crates contain items, the quality of which depends on the tier of the crate. To open a create you must hold the crate key in your hand and right click the corresponding crate. You can obtain crate keys by either purchasing them from our store, or buy buying them in our token shop. Some items on this list may not be on your server as some modpacks don't have all the mods as others.</description></item><item><title>Github Gist</title><link>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/gist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/gist/</guid><description>How to Use Github Gist While other copy and paste tools, like Pastebin or Hastebin, are more popular then Github Gist, Github Gist is one of the better copy and paste tools. It doesn't have a character count and it's just as easy to use as other tools. Using a copy and paste tool like Gist is recommended if you have issues with client crashes since it keeps the formatting of the log, and makes it easier to read the file without having to download it.</description></item><item><title>Managing Mods</title><link>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/managing-mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/managing-mods/</guid><description>Managing Your Mods Removing and adding mods can cause pack instablity. Please consult your launcher's documentation on backing up your instance prior to preforming any of the tips below.
Modded Minecraft is great and there's tons of mods you likely have in your modpacks you play every day and are unaware of. Infact, there's often a few bundled mods in packs that simply add bloat, don't provide any functionality to the end user and in the end are simply unnecessary to play the pack.</description></item><item><title>Market</title><link>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/market/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/market/</guid><description>The Market Our market plugin is a custom plugin created by our owner, ShadowKitten.

You forgot to change your Hitler skin when you were trolling, don't worry! Even though you've quickly changed it, you still lost valuable playing time.
Don't want that to happen to you? Just do one quick thing: Check your skin! If you haven't changed it in a while, it might be good to take a quick look in game by using F5 or a site like NameMC.</description></item><item><title>Relocate</title><link>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/relocate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/relocate/</guid><description>Relocation Crate relocation is a method that we have created in order to compensate for wiping servers. it will hold a limited number of items for you to be able to access them later.
Conditions to be capable of relocating Must be across servers wit the same mod pack, such as Stoneblock A to Stoneblock B May also be used to store some items to use after a map wipe Cannot be across different mod packs, such as Skyfactory to Beyond If you run /relocate a message in chat will be triggered to warn you of a few common issues:</description></item><item><title>Summoning the Ender Dragon</title><link>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/enderdragon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/enderdragon/</guid><description>Summoning the Ender Dragon This information has been depreciated and you should be able to spawn the dragon with just the 4 end crystals as per normal.
To summon the Ender Dragon, you will need 43 blocks of obsidian in your inventory and 4 end crystals.
